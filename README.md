Jist of it:

So this project is actually an administrative panel for use in a card game that I created that follows similar logic to the town of salem game.

With this administrative panel, there is about 10 pages:

Login page (done)
Register Page (done)
Tutorial Page (working on)
PlayerList Page (done)
PlayerRole Page (done)
Day Page (working on)
Night Page (working on)
Victory Page (not started)
------------------------------------

The idea of the game is applied in real life.
I recommend about 8-25 players for the gameplay, the more players, the more complex the game gets and more fun.

When I created the card game, I did not intend to have a platform, but every single time I played the game, the amount of people that were interested in participating increased and I realized that doing it all manually on a piece of paper wasn't going to cut it anymore. So since I had gotten into programming a couple of years after version 1.0 was created, I decided to implement a platform for the panel.

V1.0 does not have a platform
v2.0 does not have a platform
V3.0 does Have a platform. (written in raw HTML, CSS, JS) - A lot of it has to be watched for manually and one of the characters caused a bug.
V4.0 is what this platform is going to be used for.

This is written in ReactJs!

I'll get into more intricate details on how the card game works in the future as soon as the platform is ready to be used.
The game has plans of being released later in the future so watch out for that :)!
