# A Aquisição de Salem VERSÃO de CARTAS:

A card-game created by me based on "Cidade Dorme" a childhood game where someone in a group of people is the killer and Town of Salem, a PC game with similar mechanics.

So the card-game itself can be played without any of the online platforms, however, when the game has over 10 players, it starts to become a little overwhelming for whoever is monitoring the game. So I have applied this game over 20 times in different groups of people, and every single time it has been very successful, so the idea is to make it very easy to pick up and just play with your friends.

## Story:
So the game revolves around the late 1600s, where the salem witch trials occured.
The townsfolk are trying as hard as they can to lynch every single one of the evil doers, which involves the neutral classes and the evil classes.
